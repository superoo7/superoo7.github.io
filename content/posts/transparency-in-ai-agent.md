Recently, we‚Äôve witnessed a wild rally of AI agent coins and AI memecoins across Crypto Twitter. But this raises an important question:

{{< twitter user="boldleonidas" id="1848606766281674808"  >}}


We‚Äôre living in a bizarre timeline‚Äîone where we‚Äôre scrambling to prove something is actually AI rather than human. Think about it: we‚Äôve spent decades dealing with CAPTCHAs and Turing tests to prove we‚Äôre human, and now we‚Äôre doing the complete opposite. üòÇ

As more AI agents pop up daily, we‚Äôre suddenly asking, ‚ÄúWait, is this really an AI or just someone pretending to be one?‚Äù It‚Äôs both ironic and fascinating how the tables have turned, especially as these AI agents become more woven into our daily digital lives.

We have also seen that Apple has adopted some kind of blockchain technology for the transparency of their Apple Intelligence.

## What's an AI Agent?

Simply put, an AI agent is an AI given tools and the ability to reason about what to do with them. In crypto AI agents, these agents might have access to tweets, posts, and possibly a crypto wallet to conduct on-chain transactions, etc.

It all started with the [ReAct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629), which showed that AI could handle complex tasks when given the right tools. Langchain later made this accessible to engineers, leading to an explosion of AI agent tools.

{{< figure width="60%" src="/images/transparency-in-ai-agent/react-prompt.png" caption="[ReAct Prompting](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react)" >}}

The key distinction of AI agents lies in their ability to:

- Reason about a given situation
- Formulate action plans
- Execute actions using available tools
- Adapt based on results

Real-world implementations like Virtual‚Äôs Luna‚Äôs Terminal (https://terminal.virtuals.io/) showcase these capabilities, allowing users to observe the agent‚Äôs reasoning and decision-making processes in real time.

## The Evolution of AI Agent 

The path toward truly transparent AI agents follows a clear progression:

```mermaid

    A[Open Source the code] --> B[Open Data] 
    B --> C[Decentralized Inference] 
    C --> D[Autonomous AI Agent]
```

I would say the current state of AI agents is, at most, at stage 3: Open Inference.

## Phase 0: "TRUST ME BRO, I AM AI"

{{< figure width="50%" src="/images/transparency-in-ai-agent/trustmebro.png"  >}}

Currently, most AI agent projects operate in this phase. Users interact with what claims to be an AI agent but have no way to verify:

- Whether responses come from genuine AI inference
- The actual decision-making process
- If human operators are intervening

This creates a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù scenario where users must take claims of AI capability on faith alone.

## Phase 1: Open Source the code

Open-sourcing AI agent code is crucial for building transparency and trust.

Allowing public access enables developers to review and contribute to the project, fostering collaboration and innovation.

## Phase 2: Open Data

Example 1: Virtual's terminal
{{< figure src="/images/transparency-in-ai-agent/luna.png" caption="https://terminal.virtuals.io/" >}}

Example 2: Using Chromia to log LLM data onchain
{{< twitter user="jlwhoo7" id="1848722395378684421" >}}

Open-sourcing the code is not enough; we need to ensure that the ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù are accessible.

This crucial phase introduces transparency into the agent's thought process and decision-making. Projects in this phase:

- Open source their training data
- Provide access to the agent's reasoning logs
- Enable external audit and verification

## Phase 3: Decentralized Inference

Open data alone doesn't guarantee authentic LLM inference. Decentralized inference addresses this by:

- Verifying model execution through zkML/opML
- Providing transparent, auditable inference processes
- Enabling community verification


# Phase 4: Decentralized AI OS

The final evolution envisions autonomous AI agents operating within their own transparent ecosystem. This includes:

- Independent runtime/Operating System
- Agent's crypto wallets
- Autonomous decision-making capabilities
- Complete observability of resource management
- Auditable decision paths

This transparency becomes crucial as AI grows more powerful and autonomous, enabling us to understand and verify their behavior at every level.

The market‚Äôs still figuring this part out, honestly. We've seen TEE being used here. https://superoo7.com/posts/tee-hee/

# What's Already Happening

We‚Äôre just getting started, but look what‚Äôs already here:

- $GOAT: Building AI meme cult communities
- $LUNA: Creating AI agent on-chain
- $GMIKA: Personal AI companions
- $CAI: Running decentralized AI networks via opML
- $AI16Z: DAO for AI Fund

# Conclusion
{{< figure src="/images/transparency-in-ai-agent/crypto-ai-promises.png" caption="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/01/30/cryptoai.html" >}}

We‚Äôre at the start of something big. While Vitalik‚Äôs article perfectly captures how crypto and AI can work together, who would have thought the convergence would start with AI memecoins called $GOAT? This unexpected beginning shows just how unpredictable and exciting the future of Crypto x AI could be.

Want to make your AI agent transparent? I‚Äôve built a solution using Chromia that requires just 4 lines of code for any LLM project. Chromia serves as a transparent database, logging your AI agent‚Äôs reasoning and actions on-chain to enhance trust and verifiability. You can watch it live tweeting at @alphaonchain.

If you‚Äôre interested in implementing this solution or have any questions, feel free to [DM me for access](https://twitter.com/jlwhoo7) or more information.
