I left CoinGecko to start my own ventures into founding Hooga Gaming, which later pivoted into Chasm Network. After 3.5 years with Hooga Gaming & Chasm Network, I'm transitioning to an advisory role with Chasm Network while joining Chromia as Head of Data & AI. I'll continue supporting the Chasm team as they build upon our established foundation.

I want to take this opportunity to share what we've built as Chasm. 

Chasm Network emerged during challenging market conditions, and those familiar with my work know my commitment to building and iterating. These 3.5 years represent multiple iterations and valuable learning experiences. I'm grateful for everyone who has been part of this journey and would like to share what we've built.

As Brian Armstrong aptly said, "Actions provide information, keep doing stuff." Here's our journey of continuous building and adaptation over the past 3.5 years.

# GameFi bear market

During the GameFi winter, Hooga Gaming demonstrated adaptability by exploring new directions. We developed competitive gaming and esports initiatives, including a loyalty program using banana tokens for our scholars.

# Chasm V1

Our initial version of Chasm pioneered community engagement through Soul-bound tokens (SBT). Users could mint tokens with personal statements like "I support..." and "I believe..." While the vision was solid, market timing proved challenging.

Key challenges we faced:
- Difficult go-to-market strategy
- Cold start problem
- Intense competitive landscape

# AI Experiments and POCs

Before developing the Weave Platform, we conducted several AI experiments:

**Thread on Various Pre-Weave Platform Experiments**

**FriendTech Auto reply AI Agent**

# Our First Experiment with Crypto x AI: Tatarot / Hunem

We deployed the Tatarot app on Linea Blockchain, based on my thesis of Crypto x AI convergence through:

- Personalization
- Creativity
- Ownership

# Chasm Network

We developed Chasm Network with a lean team: 2 backend engineers/smart contract developers and 1 frontend engineer. Our vision is detailed in [our litepaper](https://chasm.net/litepaper).

For technical details, read my article on [Chasm Scout Architecture](https://superoo7.com/posts/chasm-scout-architecture-design/).

## Key Features

### Easy Deployment

We created a CLI for managing multiple scouts:

{{< twitter user="ChasmNetwork" id="1823381857700077758" >}}

Also running with just 10 steps you are able to setup your own Scout nodes. A lot of first time node runner are able to try out Chasm Scout, contribute to the network and at the same time they got airdrops for helping out.

## Loadbalance

We improved upon Bittensor's 256 validator limit by implementing push-based Orchestrator-scout relationships, reducing costs and enabling 20,000 scout nodes during testnet.

## opML
We built a decentralized AI agent ecosystem with efficient LLM resource management through OpML, recently migrating our database to Chromia.

Watch my explanation of Decentralized AI consensus:

## Cold Start Problem: Weave Platform

Addressing the cold start problem of Chasm Network, we build Weave Platform. With Weave, we are able to onboard different web2/web3 users to get use to different decentralized AI product for the first time. We've integrated EnqAI, Bittensor Corcel, etc.

# Chasm Network GTM

Our guerrilla marketing approach included several successful initiatives:
 
## 1. DeAI Jokers

{{< figure src="/images/chasm-to-chromia/deaijoker.jpeg" caption="[DEAIJoker](https://deai-is.eth.link/ )" >}}

Launched on BASE chain during April Fools' Day, this campaign playfully addressed skepticism around decentralized AI:

- Themed around "Decentralized AI is a joke!"
- Limited collection of 369 on-chain jokers
- Mint-out in just 30 minutes

## 2. Season 0 Scout Test Pilot Program

Chasm Network Test Pilot Program was deployed on Mantle, and here are the stats. The key reasoning why we manage to onboard so many users was the ease of setting up.


33,503 minted NFT on Mantle
25,591 unique testnet users
22,797 new users to Mantle

At the same time for seasoned miner, they are able to optimized it further as well.

## 3. Rethinking Points

{{< figure src="/images/chasm-to-chromia/rethinkingpoints.jpeg" caption="https://RethinkingPoints.com" >}}

Recognizing the broken points meta and prevalent sybil attacks, we launched our RethinkingPoints.com marketing campaign. I want to highlight the fact that Chasm Network make use of ELO ranking (Glicko2) instead of points and badges, so with that we are able to reward those top performing miners and prevent sybil attack from those who didn't really contribute to the network.

## 4. Rethinking Nodes

{{< figure src="/images/chasm-to-chromia/rethinkingnodes.jpeg" caption="https://RethinkingNodes.com" >}}

To address issues with a few failed node sales and build a sustainable community, we introduced RethinkingNodes. The sale concluded in 3 minutes on Ethereum Mainnet, raising $1.2 million.

## 3. Token Generation Event (TGE)

After 3 years from our initial raise, we executed our Token Generation Event (TGE) at an optimal time when Crypto x AI synergies became evident. With a solid team in place, it's an appropriate time for me to explore new opportunities.

Our small team accomplished significant milestones compared to larger projects through focused development.


# Conclusion

Looking ahead, I'm excited to bring my experience to Chromia while continuing to support Chasm Network. The Chasm team has shown their capabilities through consistent delivery and innovation - from Scout Season 0 to our successful TGE. I'm confident they will continue building and growing, even as I step into an advisory role. The collaboration between Chromia and Chasm Network opens up new possibilities in the decentralized AI space, and I'm grateful to be part of both journeys.
